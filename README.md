Tiger
=====

__Tiger__ is an automatic speech recognition application that takes a video file as input and generates a video with
subtitles as well as downloadable .txt, .vtt, .srt transcription files. Tiger generates transcriptions using the
[OpenAI Whisper](https://openai.com/blog/whisper) models.

The app is available on [ðŸ¤— Hugging Face space][Project Tiger on Hugging Face]. Please check it out.

How Project Tiger Started
-------------------------

I don't believe NLP is inherently AI. [Project Tiger](), however, enlightened me on what way should AI makes NLP more
powerful for people.

Paraphrasing movie lines has been my favorite approach to learn a foreign language. This was why I was able to speak
close-native English in early days. I used this same tactic for German today as well.

One morning I was studying German with the famous German WW2 movie
[_Generation War_](https://youtu.be/8s_0QteDapc?si=usMdIbY5Skfz0u1q). Managing to find its subtitles[^1][^2][^3] were
easy for me. A problem, however, soon arose as I proceeded with them: _the subtitles had errors - missing couple of
phrases every few other lines_. This was a big NO for language learners like me. In old days 10 years ago, I would've
reached a dead end...

Almost immediately, however, I had this idea of having AI figure out those missing words for me; so I tried
[OpenAI's Whisper](https://huggingface.co/spaces/openai/whisper) which, quite surprisingly, yield 100% accurate results.
That was the first occasion where AI produced significant solid values for my life as a language learner.

Being so excited, I decided to industrialize this process and hereby present it as [Project Tiger on Hugging Face], an
__AI movie transcription service that targets specifically for language learners__

> [!NOTE]
>
> On name "__Tiger__"
>
> The project name _tiger_ was taken from the _German heavy tank of World War II -
> [Tiger I](https://tanks-encyclopedia.com/ww2/germany/panzer-vi_tiger.php#index17)_.
>
> I chose this name because the project idea was spawned from the study of German language. More importantly, _Tiger I_
> has been widely recognized as a revolutionary tank being a crown jewels in the history of warfare technology:
>
> > _"It is tempting to view the appearance of the Tiger tank as revolutionary, ... the end result was a machine that
> > represented a quantum leap forward in tank design and changed everything - forever"_[^4]
>
> As _Tiger_ had steered the direction of next-generation heavy tank, this project has also revolutionized my view
> toward AI subconsciously and serves as an empirical guide on how I should make NLP more powerful for people with AI.
